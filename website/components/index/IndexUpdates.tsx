            <div className="text-sm sm:text-lg w-full mx-auto">As you know, The Ohio Department of Health amended its remaining health order to conform to the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, which allows those who have been vaccinated to stop wearing masks. Unfortunately, non-vaccinated people will be required to wear a mask to and from their table and when moving around the restaurant until June 2nd.

PLEASE BE ADVISED

We WILL NOT be stopping anyone without a mask.  The US Government, Our Governor and the CDC have made it clear, it is on the honor system. We are committed to maintaining and complying to health privacy acts/guidelines, which simply stated, we will NOT be asking patrons, vendors or employees if indeed they have been vaccinated.  We firmly believe in each Americanâ€™s Freedom of Choice, to choose for themself what is best.  We will continue to follow our previous cleaning and sanitizing processes as well as all other Health Department Guidelines, as we have always done.

OUR Mandatory Guidelines

Each person, including patrons, suppliers and staff, WILL BE REQUIRED to choose before entering, their need to wear a facial covering in, around or out of the restaurant.  Each patron, supplier and staff WILL BE REQUIRED to treat everyone when going into, while inside the restaurant and when leaving, with the absolute most RESPECT as they, like you, deserve it.  We WILL NOT tolerate anyone questioning anyone else, or any type of confrontation, including our restaurant staff, over anything to do with the current guidelines or the enforcement of guidelines.  If anyone is disrespectful in any way, they will be asked to leave.</div>
